due to the fact i'm running jenkins as a "normal" user (instead of as root)

	in /etc/sysconfig/jenkins:

		## Type:        string
		## Default:     "jenkins"
		## ServiceRestart: jenkins
		#
		# Unix user account that runs the Jenkins daemon
		# Be careful when you change this, as you need to update
		# permissions of $JENKINS_HOME and /var/log/jenkins.
		#
		#JENKINS_USER="jenkins"
		JENKINS_USER="trevor"

this means that after every jenkins update i need to:

	# chown -R trevor:users /var/log/jenkins* /var/cache/jenkins/


the flow for a jenkins update is:

	# systemctl stop jenkins.service
	# zypper update --download-in-advance
	# chown -R trevor:users /var/log/jenkins* /var/cache/jenkins/
	# systemctl daemon-reload
	# systemctl start jenkins.service
