ise is an old app (2013)
menu drop-downs don't seem to work correctly

multi-monitor setup:

                 +----------+
                 |          |
                 |    1     |
                 |          |
    +----------+ +----------+
    |          | |          |
    |    2     | |    3     |
    |          | |          |
    +----------+ +----------+

if app is in monitor X menu:
	X = 1, menus fine
	X = 2, no menus
	X = 3, menus show up in monitor 1
