	Failed to initialize a decoder for codec 'h264'

i installed a bunch of stuff before it started working
but it's possible the only thing i needed was the last thing i installed

	# zypper install gstreamer-plugins-libav gstreamer-plugins-ugly

it then asked if i wanted to switch a whole bunch of packages
from openSUSE to packman, i accepted, the mpv worked
