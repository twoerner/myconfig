i like using gqview to view images
openSUSE stopped included it years ago
the sources still compile:
	http://gqview.sourceforge.net/view-down.html
	gqview-2.1.5.tar.gz
but you have to add '-lm' when compiling:
	$ ./configure ...
	$ make CFLAGS=-lm

the gqview-2.1.5.tar.xz included in this repository
already has the necessary adjustment, just simply:
	$ ./configure ...
	$ make -jX
