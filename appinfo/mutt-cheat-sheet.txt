- moving around using the folder list on the left
	i've patched my mutt so that a folder list appears on the left side
	of my window. the current folder will be highlighted with a yellow
	bar. to open a new folder, move the highlight up or down using:

		Alt-j (down)
		Alt-k (up)

	when the highlight is on the folder you want to open:

		Alt-o (open)

	you can use Alt-o at any time to refresh the current folder
