There are lots of python modules/packages that i would like to install, but i
don't want to mess up the package manager of my OpenSUSE. In theory I could
just become root and do lots of "pip3 install â€¦" but that would get messy over
time.

Ideally I'd like to do installs as a regular user to my "local" area.

I already have a $HOME/local/packages where I install most things. I then use
"stow" to put things into $HOME/local or remove them.

pip3 does have a --user option that removes the need to be the root user.
Instead, everything will be placed in $HOME/.local So, to install things as a
non-root user into my own location, try the following:

	$ mkdir -p ~/local/packages/pdbpp
	$ pip3 install pdbpp \
		--install-option="--prefix=~/local/packages/pdbpp" \
		--ignore-installed \
		--verbose
	$ cd ~/local/packages
	$ stow -vvv pdbpp

--ignore-installed is a good idea as it ignores anything in ~/.local

In any case make sure your .bashrc contains:

	export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages
	export PATH=$HOME/local/bin
