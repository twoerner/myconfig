screen tips
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. when starting screen, give the session a sessionname using -S
   e.g.
   	$ screen -S <sessionname>
   then when you list your sessions, it is obvious which session is which
   e.g.
   	$ screen -ls
   	There are screens on:
   		13478.session1	(Attached)
   		12235.session2	(Attached)
   		15282.session3	(Attached)
   		\___/ \______/
   		  |       |
   		 pid   sessionname

   if you don't use -S you'll get the tty instead of a sessionname, and that's
   rarely useful

   if you did not use -S and now want to give a running session a sessionname,
   from within the session do:
   	Ctrl-a :sessionname <new sessionname>


2. to attach to an already running named session:
	$ screen -x <sessionname>

3. to detach:
	Ctrl-a d

4. to scroll back
	Ctrl-a [
	(then use vi keys to move around)

5. to create a new window, with a shell, and switch to it:
	Ctrl-a Ctrl-c
   note that windows are numbered, to switch to window #2 (for example)
   	Ctrl-a 2

6. to rename a screen
	switch to it
	Ctrl-a A    (this is case sensitive!)
