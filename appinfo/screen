screen tips
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. when starting screen, give the session a sessionname using -S
   e.g.
   	$ screen -S <sessionname>
   then when you list your sessions, it is obvious which session is which
   e.g.
   	$ screen -ls
   	There are screens on:
   		13478.session1	(Attached)
   		12235.session2	(Attached)
   		15282.session3	(Attached)
   		\___/ \______/
   		  |       |
   		 pid   sessionname

   if you don't use -S you'll get the tty instead of a sessionname, and that's
   rarely useful

   if you did not use -S and now want to give a running session a sessionname,
   from within the session do:
   	Ctrl-a :sessionname <new sessionname>


2. to attach to an already running named session:
	$ screen -x <sessionname>

3. to detach:
	Ctrl-a d

4. to scroll back
	Ctrl-a [
	(then use vi keys to move around)
	you can start a copy by hitting ENTER
	use vi keys to move around and highlight text
	hit enter again to cut the highlighted text
	use Ctrl-a ] to paste at the current cursor position

5. to create a new window, with a shell, and switch to it:
	Ctrl-a Ctrl-c
   note that windows are numbered, to switch to window #2 (for example)
   	Ctrl-a 2

6. to rename a screen
	switch to it
	Ctrl-a A    (this is case sensitive!)

7. to pass Ctrl-a to the process
	(e.g. when running qemu and you want to sent qemu a "Ctrl-a x")
	Ctrl-a a passes a Ctrl-a to the process, therefore use
	Ctrl-a a x

8. switch to the 10th (or higher) screen
	as soon as you press the "1" in "Ctrl-A 10" it will switch to screen 1
	to switch past, do:
	Ctrl-a ' <enter number>
