use download helper from youtube
$ ffmpeg -i <in.flv> -vn -acodec libvorbis <out.ogg>

to remove the audio track from a video:
	$ ffmpeg -i input.avi -vcodec copy -an output.avi

rotate a video:
	$ ffmpeg -i in.mov -vf "transpose=1" out.mov

	For the transpose parameter you can pass:
	0 = 90CounterCLockwise and Vertical Flip (default)
	1 = 90Clockwise
	2 = 90CounterClockwise
	3 = 90Clockwise and Vertical Flip

videos coming from my Nexus5x are always flipped. but the odd thing is that
they need to be run though ffmpeg, but nothing needs to be done. just simply
run them through ffmpeg and they come out fine:

	$ ffmpeg -i <videofromphone>.mp4 out.mp4

reduce the size of a video:
	- make sure to calculate the -s values, it will distort if you get
	  them wrong (mplayer will tell you when you play the video)

	$ ffmpeg -i cat.mp4 -s 270x480 -b:v 512k catsm.mp4
